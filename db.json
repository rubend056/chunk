For app clicking link would change editor, for safe clicking takes u to another page.\n\n\n----\n## Actions\nmore actions (on top of copy_id)\n- [x] select/take photo, to upload to\n- [ ] ctrl v photo\n- [x] inserting special characters, like '(' or '*', or '_' while multiple characters are selected will insert at start/end of selection instead of replacing\n\n\n---\n## Image Conversion\n[x] Images are converted to `.avif` for efficient storage. And subsequent uploads on same images will yield the converted hash instead of reprocessing the image.\n\n---\n## Formalize/separate\n[x] Formalize/separate public pages. We'll use `/page/<id>` for published static pages and `/preview/<id>` for live editor on chunkapp. This also advances a Gibos project milestone.\n- [ ] **js runtime for rust**, `deno_core` as a wrapper for v8 seems like the way to go. So we're able to render `/page/<id>` on backend.\n\n----\n## Relationship Upgrade \n- No aggregated strucuture for relationship. Instead dynamic relation lookup on query.\n- For faster ref->id lookups well use a HashMap\n\n[x] Currently if a user shares a child note but not parent, other user wont be able to see it at all on the well. Fixed!\n- Get all nodes user has read access to.  \n- If we're at the root also return whats shared with read but who's parent the user doesnt have read access to. So as to show orphans.\n- Ref count also has to be calculated on the spot, so for each node we gotta calculate how many others are reffing these.\n\n\nshare: public r","owner":"rubend","created":1667656511,"modified":1669667451},{"id":"bagoj_nubud","value":"# WORK -> vulij_hagah\n\n- FINISH UPDATING ACCEPTED TO CLIENT IN PROPOSALS TAB \n- FINISH DOING FOLLOW UPS FOR WFC PROPOSALS \n- DO FOLLOW UPS FOR INFO REQUEST PROPOSALS ","owner":"sara","created":1672416395,"modified":1673531754},{"id":"baniv_pufup","value":"# An example of formal systems -> fokuh_vokus\n\nA **formal system** is an _abstract structure_ used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. \n\nThese rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the logical calculus of the formal system.

reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vzxnvc/comment/j3w6lp4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to \"C# vs Rust?\"\n\nI recently learned the language to finally answer this question from **GEB**:\n\nTo put it simply: Rust is a [**formal system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system) with a closer [**isomorphism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism) to human language and logic than C# ever will, mainly because of it's insanely powerful borrow checker / inference system and it's balance of academic simplicity vs practical usefulness.\n\nThe community in itself is highly rational, promoting the same from the programmers and programs it creates.\n\nI find myself liberated in Rust compared to all the other programming languages I've learned before, C# being my first in Unity3D, then C++ in Arduino. \n\nPs, if you're a Web dev [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is an analog to Rust in the embedded environment I found.\n","owner":"rubend","created":1673444940,"modified":1673448107},{"id":"baruh_kijug","value":"# User Security -> zubat_fonal\n\n**Defines** a <u>user's security</u> and the **actions** an admin

So **they themselves don't get lost** trying to check off item 1, when item 1 has 10 more items underneath (WRITE THEM DOWN and CHECK THEM OFF).\n\n- Multiple **smaller tasks are better** than 1 HUGE task. Aim for the first task under a feature to be a [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of the Feature, because:\n\t- You know the _Feature itself is still an **obsure idea**_, and you **don't want to push for something final** on an idea that's **still obscure** and tomorrow could be completely rewritten, that would indeed be **madness**.\n\t- In fact **if this is done, it's fatal**, the **ramifications are inmense**. If too much time is spent implementing something obscure the person/group **won't be open to changes on the idea itself** (even if they're better) because they've invested so much and **don't want to admit they wasted their time**. Be willing to **cut your losses and start over**.\n\t- It's **easy to add**, **much much harder to subtract**. Sometimes things just have to be **written from scratch**. From experience, I've never rewritten logic/code that I've regretted, because literally **ALL the time it comes out 10x simpler in 100x less time** (because most of the time as a programmer I've denied writing anything but code), you just have to know **when and what** to rewrite.\n \t- **_TLDR_**: Only **implement the parts of the Feature** that are **[CLEAR and DISTINCT](http://mrhoyestokwebsite.com/WOKs/Emotion/Useful%20Information/Clear%20and%20Distinct%20Ideas.htm)** (\"something that is **so self-evidently true** that it **cannot logically be doubted**\"), at the very least that is the goal, to come up with things that stand the test of logic and time.\n\nExample: \n- [ ] Update endpoints to conform\n- [ ] Do Logic for User Management\n- [ ] Consolidate X Entity into Y and make them inherit from Z. \n\n---\n#### Details\nAnything you want to clarify, I've gone more in-depth for each specific UI/API example below V.\n\n---\n---\n## Task 25 UI (Example)\n\nI've taken a look at the UI and I think we can condense a lot of these User Management views into 1 solution. \n\nSo let's clean up the mess happening on the Drawer and make a final User Manage page to be proud of. \n\nLmk if there's something that you don't understand, or that would require massive structural changes and we'll fix it.\n\n\n##### Breakdown\n\n- [ ] X Button/Modal\n- [ ] Y Button/Modal\n- [ ] Consolidate Page X into Z. \n\n---\n##### Details\n\n###### Modal X\n`<SKETCH>`\n###### Modal Y\n`<SKETCH>`  \nYou **need** to show \"blah blah\" message after success.\n\n###### Page X Consolidation\nThis validation not here, but there...\n\n---\n---\n## Task 26 API (Example)\n\nI've taken a look at the **Endpoints** and **Entities** currently defined and I think we can condense a lot of these Endpoints into 4 actions once and for all. \n\nReally the feature has most of what you need and I've written below some comments. \n\nLmk if there's something that you don't understand, or that would require massive structural changes and we'll fix it.\n\n##### Breakdown\n\n- [ ] Update endpoints to conform\n- [ ] Do Logic for User Management\n- [ ] Consolidate X Entity into Y and make them inherit from Z. \n\n---\n##### Details\nExplanation of **backend logic** in case **business logic is too complex** and **Feature wasn't specific enough**.  \n\nThe **feature's explanation is preferred** to this (for clarity and simplicity), but nontheless there could be something really specific to clarify so I leave the option.\n\nShare: public r, rprieto06 r, dcruzp r, david r","owner":"rubend","created":1670973798,"modified":1672758541},{"id":"rusat_tusur","value":"# 8158 -> mofid_radaf\n\nIt's 00:44, I'm still organizing this ssshh...\n\n---","owner":"rubend","created":1671686450,"modified":1671686450},{"id":"salak_mobiz","value":"# Task 23 UI -> josil_tonan,dozan_sopal\n\nEsto referencia [Authentication](chunk/josil_tonan).\n\n- [x] Update Login/Register/Forgot/Reset definitions.

It also attempts to reconnect to websocket after a specified timeout if connection is closed for any reason.\n\n**User Session**: A tab opened in a browser that holds UI State. A logged in user has a `user` claim on token, or if non-logged in, he's treated as `public`. A logged in user can have multiple tabs open and they would all be different **User Sessions** by this definition.\n\n**Diff**: An array that represents changes to text (by lines). Example `[\"K12\",\"Atest\",\"A\",\"K17\"]`, that means Keep first 12 lines, Add line \"test\", Add empty line \"\", Keep 17 lines. This diff is necessary to keep the cursor in the right place on other User Sessions that are updating their `<textarea>`, if value is replaced and  cursor `selectionStart/End` isn't moved the browser jumps to end of `<textarea>` making live editing impossible.\n\n### Steps (on Websocket)\n\n#### Editor (User Session)\n1. User Session **opens Chunk X** for editing, **subscribes** to `chunk/<id>` and `chunk/<id>/diff`.\n1. Subscription to `chunk/<id>` makes **Store Request** `chunk/<id>` -> Server\n1. **Server sends** `chunk/<id>` -> User Session \n1. If User Session detects `<textarea>` **modifications** and does next step after **500ms** of no more modifications.\n1. **User Session sends** Chunk X's **Value** -> Server\n1. **Server sends Ok** -> User Session, which makes User Session distribute the change across the UI, except for `<textarea>` which is where the change initiated (to prevent editing hickups in case user typed anything else while this process was happening).\n\n#### Listener (User Session)\n1. After events on Editor User Session\n1. **Server sends Diff** -> _Opened_ User Sessions who's user has read access on Chunk X.\n1. **User Session** applies Diff to state at `chunk/<id>`.\n\n\nUI really is a **game of state management**. It's a pain to figure out how many states you need and how they interact.

You can hold in the palm of your hand and power with a measily 10W or a small solar panel. Place anywhere in your home, pull up the browser/app, and take notes, save files, social media away locally or with other boxes/servers. Yes, it's \"the cloud\", yes it's not a cloud its just that little thing that fits on your hand answering questions and solving problems. Can you take ur box on your field trip? yes. Can you take this box to your bunker? yes. Can you eat spaguetti next to the thing that's organizing your life for you, and making u a better human being because of it, yes.\n\nYes that's possible, it's been for a decade now, it's just not ideal for you to know how simple, or cheap, it is.

Simple\n   1. **To Use**: Progressively finer controls depending on consumer skill level.\n   2. **Maintain**: A minimal web interface.\n   3. **Replace/Clone**: Optional backups to storage devices, or another box (somewhere else, maybe the cloud).\n   4. **Expand**: Optional aditional expanded storage/processsing (swarm with sharding/parallellism).\n   5. **Modify**: It's yours, if you have physical access to it, you can do as you wish. But data can be optionally encrypted at your discretion.\n3.

Y si no viene con `id` funciona como un POST, pero eso una consequencia de la manera q esta escrito, no parte de un if/else me entiendes. No debes escribirlo pensando oh, con id entonces esto, oh, sin id entonces esto. Debes escribirlo como \n```\nlet agent = id ? find_by_id : create_and_return_entity;\n\nagent.blah blah = blah\n```\n## Entiendes?\nsi . ok eso es facil . pero con esos datos sol oestan involucrados la tabla Agent y Contact y podemos seguir con esa idea. si id = null entonces es nuevo el record , sino entonces es un update. \nEn el Json de abajo . puedes llenar solo esos campos y va a funcionar de la misma manera. \n\n__Ok feo, espera, yo puedo hacerte eso super facil, en los campos <Field > en el UI yo puedo hacerte <Field  name=\"agent.contact.firstName\"> y te va a usar ese campo, crear objeto tras objeto si el campo no existe, es super automatico, pero lo q me preocupa es la manera en q vas a trabajar eso, a ver, cual es tu psudocodigo ahora mismo?__\n```\nforeach entity \n      entity.deleted \n\nforeach entity \n     if entity new \n         entity.state = new \n     else \n         entity.state = modified \n```\n## Para ti q es un entity? dejame terminar . \n- todo el arbold de expresion .

Y te dejo q pruebes con el website tu API local. Tienes q asegurarte q GET /agent/{id} tenga la misma estructura porque cuando valla a editar, se va a llamar a GET {id} primero, editar, y despues PUT, ok.\n\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/MH8Bk0T1/image.png)\nYo ya tengo un GET /agent/{id} q trae esto\n```\nexport interface AgentSimple {\n\tid: string\n\tcontactId: string\n\tname?: string\n\tfirstName?: string\n\tmiddleName?: string\n\tlastName?: string\n}\nexport interface Agent extends AgentSimple {\n\tcreatedDate: string\n\tcreatedBy: string\n\tupdatedBy: string\n\tupdatedDate: string\n\tloginEmail: string\n\tphone: string\n\tnpn: string\n\tagentTypeName: string\n\tlocationName: string\n\tstatusName: string\n\tlocationId: string\n\tstatusId: string\n\tagentTypeId: string\n}\n```\nReescribe ese endpoint para q use el nuevo formato entonces pq aqui es donde unico q usa eso.\n\nClaro . ese get el modelo que va a retornar es el mismo con el que se ve a hacer el PUT .
