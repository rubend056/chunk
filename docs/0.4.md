Wasn't able to in that time :(, only what's completed below.

## Easy
- [] Logout button.
- [x] Token cookie expires in 1 week.
- [-] Trash color + selected color
- [x] Checkbox syntax  
[ ] -> &#x2610;  
[x] -> &#x2612;
- [] Add icons in well/chunks sidebar
- [] Adding chunk on well links with parent

## Medium
- [] Preview id + copy/link buttons.

## Hard
- [] Public preview only page.
  - Adding a second target to parcel for a light page that only loads (water.css + chunk.css) and js for (chunkToHtml) code.

  - Adding a second target to parcel for a light page that only loads (water.css + chunk.css) and js for (chunkToHtml) code.  (Too difficult, no payoff, maybe later)
  - Nothing, just try the preview/link see what happens, and tell Edit to behave differently when set from /path/:id

Went off the specs a bit, since I also made a small notification system, but completed at 13:53pm, rounds to 2pm on 11/4/2022.
